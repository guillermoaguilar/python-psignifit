# Get standard parameters

The python version of psignifit does not yet contain the parameter
conversion utility that the MATLAB version has,
[as described here](https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit/wiki/How-to-Get-Standard-Parameters).

We are working in implenting this utility. Take a look at the [github issues](https://github.com/wichmann-lab/python-psignifit/issues) 
to check out our progress.
